# 👕 Garments Worker Productivity Clustering

## 📌 Project Description

This project performs **Clustering Analysis** on the **Garments Worker Productivity dataset** to group workers based on their productivity and work-related attributes.
The main objective is to identify different productivity patterns among garment workers using **unsupervised machine learning techniques**.

This project is developed as a **mini project** to gain hands-on experience with clustering, data preprocessing, and exploratory analysis.
